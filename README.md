# Bike rental database

Here is the file that contains my practice script from freecodecamp Relational Database courses.
The script was created by following the instructions of the course. The idea of practice is to 
write a script in shell to insert and query the data from the created database. The database was called 
"bikes" and it contains three tables such as; "rentals", "customers", "bikes". It gives a chance to 
rent a bike from the bikes table if it is available and make a record of the time of rent and customer info.
Customer is identified by their phone number as everyone has unique phone number. When rented bike is returned,
its status changes back to available in "rentals" table. I want to thank freecodecamp for providing an oportunity
to learn and study new field.
